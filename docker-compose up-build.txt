### Usage

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the API using the following endpoints:

- `POST /recipes`: Add a new recipe.
- `GET /recipes`: Retrieve a list of all recipes.
- `GET /recipes/<recipe_id>`: Retrieve details of a specific recipe.
- `PUT /recipes/<recipe_id>`: Update a specific recipe.
- `DELETE /recipes/<recipe_id>`: Delete a specific recipe.
- `POST /recipes/<recipe_id>/ratings`: Rate a specific recipe.
- `POST /recipes/<recipe_id>/comments`: Comment on a specific recipe.
- `GET /recipes/<recipe_id>/comments`: Retrieve all comments for a specific recipe.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality, readability, and organization.
- Proper implementation of the API and database interactions.
- Proper use of Docker for containerization.
- Handling edge cases and error scenarios.

### Bonus Tasks

- Implementation of user authentication, search functionality, recipe suggestions, and unit tests.
